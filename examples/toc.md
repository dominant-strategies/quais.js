# Introduction

Welcome to the `quais.js` examples repository! This collection of Node.js files is designed to help developers explore and understand the various capabilities of the `quais.js` library, which provides essential tools and utilities for working with the Quai blockchain. Whether you are deploying smart contracts, managing HD wallets, or sending and verifying transactions, these examples will guide you through practical implementations and best practices.

Our repository is a work in progress, and we are continually adding more examples to cover a wider range of use cases. Below is the current table of contents, which outlines the topics and corresponding example files. Each file includes detailed code snippets and explanations to facilitate your learning process.

We encourage you to explore the examples, experiment with the code, and reach out to us with any questions or feedback.

Happy coding!
