```ts
function getAddress(address): string
```

Returns a normalized and checksumed address for `address`. This accepts non-checksum addressesa and checksum
addresses.

The checksum in Quai uses the capitalization (upper-case vs lower-case) of the characters within an address to encode
its checksum, which offers, on average, a checksum of 15-bits.

If `address` contains both upper-case and lower-case, it is assumed to already be a checksum address and its checksum
is validated, and if the address fails its expected checksum an error is thrown.

If you wish the checksum of `address` to be ignore, it should be converted to lower-case (i.e. `.toLowercase()`)
before being passed in. This should be a very rare situation though, that you wish to bypass the safeguards in place
to protect against an address that has been incorrectly copied from another source.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type |
| :------ | :------ |
| `address` | `string` |

## Returns

`string`

## Example

```js
// Adds the checksum (via upper-casing specific letters)
getAddress('0x8ba1f109551bd432803012645ac136ddd64dba72');
//_result:

// Throws an error if an address contains mixed case,
// but the checksum fails
getAddress('0x8Ba1f109551bD432803012645Ac136ddd64DBA72');
//_error:
```
