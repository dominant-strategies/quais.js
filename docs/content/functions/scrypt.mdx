```ts
function scrypt(
   _passwd, 
   _salt, 
   N, 
   r, 
   p, 
   dkLen, 
progress?): Promise<string>
```

The [scrypt PBKDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt) uses a memory and cpu hard method of derivation to increase
the resource cost to brute-force a password for a given key.

This means this algorithm is intentionally slow, and can be tuned to become slower. As computation and memory speed
improve over time, increasing the difficulty maintains the cost of an attacker.

For example, if a target time of 5 seconds is used, a legitimate user which knows their password requires only 5
seconds to unlock their account. A 6 character password has 68 billion possibilities, which would require an attacker
to invest over 10,000 years of CPU time. This is of course a crude example (as password generally aren't random), but
demonstrates to value of imposing large costs to decryption.

For this reason, if building a UI which involved decrypting or encrypting datsa using scrypt, it is recommended to
use a [**ProgressCallback**](../types-aliases/ProgressCallback) (as event short periods can seem lik an eternity if
the UI freezes). Including the phrase //"decrypting"// in the UI can also help, assuring the user their waiting is
for a good reason.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `_passwd` | [`BytesLike`](/sdk/content/type-aliases/BytesLike) | The password to use. |
| `_salt` | [`BytesLike`](/sdk/content/type-aliases/BytesLike) | The salt to use. |
| `N` | `number` | The CPU/memory cost parameter. |
| `r` | `number` | The block size parameter. |
| `p` | `number` | The parallelization parameter. |
| `dkLen` | `number` | The length of the key to generate. |
| `progress`? | [`ProgressCallback`](/sdk/content/type-aliases/ProgressCallback) | A callback to update the progress. |

## Returns

`Promise`\<`string`\>

The key derived from the password.

## Example

```ts
// The password must be converted to bytes, and it is generally
// best practices to ensure the string has been normalized. Many
// formats explicitly indicate the normalization form to use.
password = 'hello';
passwordBytes = toUtf8Bytes(password, 'NFKC');

salt = id('some-salt');

// Compute the scrypt
scrypt(passwordBytes, salt, 1024, 8, 1, 16);
//_result:
```
