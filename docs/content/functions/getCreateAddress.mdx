```ts
function getCreateAddress(tx): string
```

Returns the address that would result from a `CREATE` for `tx`.

This can be used to compute the address a contract will be deployed to by an EOA when sending a deployment
transaction (i.e. when the `to` address is `null`).

This can also be used to compute the address a contract will be deployed to by a contract, by using the contract's
address as the `to` and the contract's nonce.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| :------ | :------ | :------ |
| `tx` | `object` | The transaction object. |
| `tx.data` | `null` \| `string` | The data of the transaction. |
| `tx.from` | `string` | The address of the sender. |
| `tx.nonce` | [`BigNumberish`](/sdk/content/type-aliases/BigNumberish) | The nonce of the sender. |

## Returns

`string`

## Example

```js
from = '0x8ba1f109551bD432803012645Ac136ddd64DBA72';
nonce = 5;

getCreateAddress({ from, nonce });
//_result:
```
