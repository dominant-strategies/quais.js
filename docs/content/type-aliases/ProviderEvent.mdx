```ts
type ProviderEvent: string | (string | string[])[] | EventFilter | OrphanFilter;
```

A **ProviderEvent** provides the types of events that can be subscribed to on a [**Provider**](/sdk/content/interfaces/Provider).

Each provider may include additional possible events it supports, but the most commonly supported are:

**`"block"`** - calls the listener with the current block number on each new block.

**`"error"`** - calls the listener on each async error that occurs during the event loop, with the error.

**`"debug"`** - calls the listener on debug events, which can be used to troubleshoot network errors, provider
problems, etc.

**`transaction hash`** - calls the listener on each block after the transaction has been mined; generally `.once` is
more appropriate for this event.

**`Array`** - calls the listener on each log that matches the filter.

[**EventFilter**](/sdk/content/interfaces/EventFilter) - calls the listener with each matching log
