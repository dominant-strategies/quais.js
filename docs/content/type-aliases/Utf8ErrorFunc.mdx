```ts
type Utf8ErrorFunc: (reason, offset, bytes, output, badCodepoint?) => number;
```

A callback that can be used with [**toUtf8String**](/sdk/content/functions/toUtf8String) to analysis or recovery from invalid UTF-8
data.

Parsing UTF-8 data is done through a simple Finite-State Machine (FSM) which calls the `Utf8ErrorFunc` if a fault is
detected.

The `reason` indicates where in the FSM execution the fault occurred and the `offset` indicates where the input
failed.

The `bytes` represents the raw UTF-8 data that was provided and `output` is the current array of UTF-8 code-points,
which may be updated by the `Utf8ErrorFunc`.

The value of the `badCodepoint` depends on the `reason`. See [**Utf8ErrorReason**](/sdk/content/type-aliases/Utf8ErrorReason) for
details.

The function should return the number of bytes that should be skipped when control resumes to the FSM.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type |
| :------ | :------ |
| `reason` | [`Utf8ErrorReason`](/sdk/content/type-aliases/Utf8ErrorReason) |
| `offset` | `number` |
| `bytes` | `Uint8Array` |
| `output` | `number`[] |
| `badCodepoint`? | `number` |

## Returns

`number`
