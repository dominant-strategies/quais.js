A **ContractRunner** is a generic interface which defines an object capable of interacting with a Contract on the
network.

The more operations supported, the more utility it is capable of.

The most common ContractRunners are [Providers](../classes/Provider) which enable read-only access and
[Signers](../classes/Signer) which enable write-access.
