## Properties

| Property | Type | Description |

| `blockHash` | `string` | The block hash of the block that included this transaction. |
| `blockNumber` | `number` | The block number of the block that included this transaction. |
| `contractAddress` | `null` \| `string` | If the transaction was directly deploying a contract, the [**to**](/content/interfaces/TransactionReceiptParams) will be<br />null, the `data` will be initcode and if successful, this will be the address of the contract deployed. |
| `cumulativeGasUsed` | `bigint` | The total amount of gas consumed during the entire block up to and including this transaction. |
| `effectiveGasPrice?` | `null` \| `bigint` | The actual gas price per gas charged for this transaction. |
| `from` | `string` | The sender of the transaction. |
| `gasPrice?` | `null` \| `bigint` | The actual gas price per gas charged for this transaction. |
| `gasUsed` | `bigint` | The amount of gas consumed executing this transaciton. |
| `hash` | `string` | The transaction hash. |
| `index` | `number` | The transaction index. |

| `status` | `null` \| `number` | The status of the transaction execution. If `1` then the the transaction returned success, if `0` then the<br />transaction was reverted. For pre-byzantium blocks, this is usually null, but some nodes may have backfilled this<br />data. |
