| `blockHash` | `string` | The block hash of the block that included this transaction. |
| `blockNumber` | `number` | The block number of the block that included this transaction. |
| `contractAddress` | `null` \| `string` | If the transaction was directly deploying a contract, the [**to**](/sdk/content/interfaces/TransactionReceiptParams) will be<br />null, the `data` will be initcode and if successful, this will be the address of the contract deployed. |
| `cumulativeGasUsed` | `bigint` | The total amount of gas consumed during the entire block up to and including this transaction. |
| `effectiveGasPrice?` | `null` \| `bigint` | The actual gas price per gas charged for this transaction. |
| `from` | `string` | The sender of the transaction. |
| `gasPrice?` | `null` \| `bigint` | The actual gas price per gas charged for this transaction. |
