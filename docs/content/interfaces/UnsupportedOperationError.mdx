title: UnsupportedOperationError
---

This Error indicates that the attempted operation is not supported.

This could range from a specific JSON-RPC end-point not supporting a feature to a specific configuration of an object
prohibiting the operation.

For example, a [Wallet](../classes/Wallet) with no connected [Provider](../interfaces/Provider) is unable to send a
transaction.
