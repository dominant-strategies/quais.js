/**
 * When interacting with Ethereum, it is necessary to use a private key authenticate actions by signing a payload.
 *
 * Wallets are the simplest way to expose the concept of an Externally Owner Account (EOA) as it wraps a private key and
 * supports high-level methods to sign common types of interaction and send transactions.
 *
 * The class most developers will want to use is [Wallet](../classes/Wallet), which can load a private key directly or
 * from any common wallet format.
 *
 * The [QuaiHDWallet](../classes/QuaiHDWallet) can be used when it is necessary to access low-level details of how an HD
 * wallets are derived, exported or imported.
